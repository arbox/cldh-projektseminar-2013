TTR: 
Relation between Wordtokens and Wordtypes.

Simple_TTR:
Easy method to calculate the TTR. It divides the total typecount with the number of tokens. The longer a text gets, the smaller will be the TTR.

MTLD: 
Measure of textual lexical diversity. Another measure for Type-Token-Ratio. Does work better with long Texts.

KGM: 
Short for Köhler-Galle-Method, another measure. Considers the length and dynamic of a text.

Stemming:
Rule-based, automatic reduction of inflected words to their stem.
This programm offers implementations of the Porter-Stemmer for english, german or russian texts.
